# Journey to Full Stack 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning repository as I transition from a creative background in 3D design and animation into the technical world of **Full Stack Web Development**.

This space documents my progress as I build a foundation in programming, front-end/back-end development, and modern web technologies.

## 📌 Why this repo?

This repository acts as my **learning log**, where I:
- Practice hands-on assignments and small projects
- Track progress through various technical topics
- Maintain consistent version control habits
- Reflect on key lessons learned along the way

> I’m sharing this publicly to learn in the open, stay accountable, and connect with others on a similar path.
